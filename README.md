# Xysti

Xysti is an on-demand, intelligent assistant to help you find sports and physical activity sessions which are happening in your local area (or where-ever you choose!). It learns your likes, dislikes, skill levels, favourite places to play sport, and will suggest where you could play them. Simply ask 'where can I play squash tomorrow after work?' and Xysti will find a leisure centre with a squash court available.

I am building this for my Final Year project at Brunel University, for my computer science degree. It is primarily built off [React Redux Universal Hot Example](https://github.com/erikras/react-redux-universal-hot-example) by erikras.
